# RegExHelp

This is a stand-alone help system that can be used instead of Dyalog APL's single page on Regular Expressions the interpreter comes with.

Providing the massive amount of information on a single page makes it difficult to use. Splitting it into several pages, 
providing a tree structure, offering a powerful search feature and a proper index makes life significantly easier when 
it comes to Regular Expressions.

In addition the help system also includes the "PCRE Syntax summary" which is coming as a seperate document in a standard Dyalog 
implementation.
