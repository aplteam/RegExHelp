 'By default, `d`, `s` and `w` match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode or in the 16- bit and 32-bit libraries. '
 'However, if locale-specific matching is happening, `s` and `w` may also match characters with code points in the range 128-255. '
 'If the PCRE_UCP option ("UCP" in Dyalog APL) is set, the behaviour of these escape sequences is changed to use Unicode properties '
 'and they match many more characters.'
