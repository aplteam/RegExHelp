# Backtracking control

The following act immediately they are reached:

|`(*ACCEPT)`|  force successful match
|`(*FAIL)`|   force backtrack; synonym (*F)
|`(*MARK:NAME)`| set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)


The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a back-
track to reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in
what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do
so only if the pattern is not anchored.
 
|`(*COMMIT)`  | overall failure, no advance of starting point
|`(*PRUNE)`  | advance to next starting character
|`(*PRUNE:NAME)` | equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE)
|`(*SKIP)`  | advance to current matching position
|`(*SKIP:NAME)` | advance to position corresponding to an earlier<<br>>(*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
|`(*THEN)`  | local failure, backtrack to next alternation
|`(*THEN:NAME)` | equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)
